# Schwifty 0.1
Lite Version of Swift: for fun

The intent of Schwifty is to be even more light weight and easy to use than Swfit. It does this by dropping support for everything but assigning variables, arithmetic and if statements.

Start by creating a new Schwifty Compiler, choose to either create a syntx highlighter or not. Then designate a SchwiftyDelegate. You can receive NSAtrributedString from SchwiftyCompiler.attributedString.
